# Array
---
An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations. Itâ€™s one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement other data structures. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0. Each element in an array is accessed through its index.

### Types of array
- 1D array
- Multi-D array

### Array Operations
- Traversal: Visiting each element of an array in a specific order
- Insertion: Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
- Deletion: Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
- Searching: FInding the index of an element in an array.

# Dynamic arrays

One simple way of implementing dynamic arrays is, intially start with some fixed size array. as soon as that array becomes full, create the new array of size double than the original array. similarly, reduce the array size to half if the elemnts in the array are less than half.
